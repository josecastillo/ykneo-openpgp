= Setting number of PIN retries

== Introduction

This is an instruction for changing the number of retries possible for a PIN code
with the ykneo-openpgp applet.

== Prerequisites

For this procedure, you must have ykneo-openpgp applet version 1.0.7 or later
installed.  To check the applet version run the following.

....
 $ gpg-connect-agent --hex "scd apdu 00 f1 00 00" /bye
 D[0000]  01 00 07 90 00                                     .....
 OK
....

The string "01 00 07" means version 1.0.7.

== Setting the PIN retries

When the retry counter is changed the all PIN codes will be reset to default
(123456 for user PIN and 12345678 for admin PIN).

For the command to be available the admin PIN must first be validated.

The command consists of the instruction (f2) and three values as data, those are in
order: retries for user PIN, retries for reset code and retries for admin PIN.

In this example the admin PIN is first validated, then all three values are set to
5 retries:
....
 $ gpg-connect-agent --hex "scd apdu 00 20 00 83 08 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38" \
   "scd apdu 00 f2 00 00 03 05 05 05" /bye
....
